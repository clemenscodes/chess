/**
 * The "api" package contains the API definitions for the Chess MVC (Model-View-Controller) game.
 * This API defines interfaces and contracts that must be implemented by the concrete
 * classes in the controller, model, and view components of the Chess game.
 *
 * <p><strong>Controller API</strong></p>
 * The controller API defines the interactions between the user interface and the game model.
 * It includes methods for handling user input, managing game state, and facilitating communication
 * between the model and view components.
 *
 * <p><strong>Model API</strong></p>
 * The model API outlines the structure and behavior of the Chess game model. It includes
 * interfaces for managing the game state, enforcing game rules, and providing information
 * about the current game status. Implementations of this API represent the core logic of the game.
 *
 * <p><strong>View API</strong></p>
 * The view API describes the interfaces that must be implemented by classes responsible for
 * rendering the game's graphical user interface. It includes methods for displaying the game board,
 * updating the user interface based on the model state, and handling user interactions with the view.
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
 * Developers implementing the Chess game should refer to this API module to ensure that their
 * concrete classes adhere to the defined contracts. The use of these APIs promotes modularity,
 * extensibility, and adherence to the MVC architectural pattern.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
 * Concrete implementations of the controller, model, and view components should be provided in
 * separate modules, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and promoting code maintainability.
 * Developers should instantiate and wire these implementations together to create a functional Chess game.
