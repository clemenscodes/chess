/**
 * The {@link model} package contains the implementation of a chess game using
 * bitboards. It provides the core logic for managing the state of the game,
 * enforcing chess rules,
 * and handling interactions between different game components.
 *
 * <p>
 * The package has a dependency on the {@link api} package, which defines the
 * interfaces
 * and abstractions used by the chess model. This allows for a clear separation
 * of concerns
 * and facilitates future modifications or extensions to the chess game.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For unit testing, the package utilizes JUnit to ensure the correctness of its
 * functionalities. This involves testing various aspects of the chess model,
 * including
 * move generation, game state transitions, and adherence to chess rules.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The primary focus of this package is the efficient representation of the
 * chessboard
 * using bitboards, which enables faster move generation and evaluation.
 * </p>
