/**
 * The 'lib' package contains classes and interfaces that form the core components of the Tic Tac Toe
 * game implementation. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to organize and separate
 * concerns, providing modularity and maintainability. The package includes the game model
 * ({@link lib.model.TicTacToeModel}), the game view interfaces ({@link lib.view.ITicTacToeView}),
 * and the game controller interfaces ({@link lib.controller.ITicTacToeController}). These components
 * collectively define the structure and behavior of the Tic Tac Toe game and facilitate interaction
 * between the game logic, user interface, and user input.
